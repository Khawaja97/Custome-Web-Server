# Custome-Web-Server



  A simple web-server.  

  The objective of this C++ program is to:

 • Develop a web-server that can process HTTP GET requests.
 
 • Recollect the use of HTTP protocol for communication.
 
 • Work with anonymous pipes.
 
 • Run a program with command-line arguments and return its outputs back to the client.
 
 • Continue to gain familiarity with I/O streams & string processing.


  Background: 

     The web-server performs the following tasks:
  
      1. Accepts connection from a client.
      2. Processes cgi-bin GET request.
      3. If not cgi-bin, it responds with the specific file or a 404.
